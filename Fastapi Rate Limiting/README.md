# FastAPI Rate Limiting

## Description

This project provides an example implementation of rate limiting in a FastAPI application. It demonstrates how to restrict the number of requests a client can make to your API within a specified time window, helping to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

This project demonstrates how to implement rate limiting in a FastAPI application. Rate limiting helps protect your API from abuse by restricting the number of requests a client can make in a given time period.

## Features

- Simple and configurable rate limiting middleware
- Example endpoints to test rate limiting
- Easy integration with existing FastAPI projects

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the relevant files into your FastAPI project.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
4. Test the endpoints using your preferred HTTP client.

## Configuration

You can adjust the rate limiting parameters (such as requests per minute) in the middleware or settings file.
