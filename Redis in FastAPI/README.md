## Redis in FastAPI

This project demonstrates how to integrate Redis with FastAPI to leverage caching and session management capabilities. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. By integrating Redis with FastAPI, you can improve the performance and scalability of your applications by caching responses, managing sessions, and storing temporary data efficiently.
